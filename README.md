PlatformIO development platform for LN882H, BK7231 and RTL8710 IoT chips.

The main goal of this project is to provide a usable build environment for IoT developers. While also providing vendor SDKs as PlatformIO cores,
the project focuses on developing working Arduino-compatible cores for supported families. The cores are inspired by Espressif's official core for ESP32,
which should make it easier to port/run existing ESP apps on less-common, unsupported IoT modules.

**There's an [ESPHome port](https://docs.libretiny.eu/docs/projects/esphome/) based on LibreTiny, which supports BK7231 and RTL8710B chips.**

**Note:** this project is work-in-progress.
